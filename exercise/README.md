# Week1: Draw a Function Graph in Colab
- Draw a graph like quadratic functions
- In [week1.ipynb](https://github.com/tangYang7/GAI/blob/main/exercise/week1.ipynb), examples using both **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are provided.

# Week2: Create My Own DNN
- Implement a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) for handwritten digit recognition.
- The neural network consists of **five layers**.
- In [week2.ipynb](https://github.com/tangYang7/GAI/blob/main/exercise/week2.ipynb), the model achieves **95% accuracy** after training for 100 epochs.

# Week3: Cross Entropy & KL Divergence: Explanation, Computation, and Comparison
- For details, please see [week3_topic2.ipynb](https://github.com/tangYang7/GAI/blob/main/exercise/week3_topic2.ipynb).

# Week4: Build my own benchmarks
- Create my own set of benchmarks (prompts)
- Write down your thoughts on these models' responses. Which one do you prefer and why?
- For details, please see [week4.ipynb](https://github.com/tangYang7/GAI/blob/main/exercise/week4.ipynb).
