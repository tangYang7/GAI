# Week1: Draw a Function Graph in Colab
- Draw a graph like quadratic functions
- In [Week1.ipynb](https://github.com/tangYang7/GAI/blob/main/exercise/week1.ipynb), examples using both **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are provided.

# Week2: Create My Own DNN
- Implement a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) for handwritten digit recognition.
  - The neural network consists of **five layers**.
  - In [Week2.ipynb](https://github.com/tangYang7/GAI/blob/main/exercise/week2.ipynb), the model achieves **95% accuracy** after training for 100 epochs.
